This is an amalgamation of different codes meant to run E.O.S.' or analyze the thermals of different objects for heat transfer rate, or coefficients.
For anyone visiting this, do take a look around! They were made for Thermodynamics, Kinetics, and Heat Transfer ultimately, so they may be of many uses. I plan on integrating them and making them much more efficient iA later down the line.
